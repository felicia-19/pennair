# Video Processing Report
### Approach

Applied the static image algorithm frame-by-frame.
Used the same HSV-based segmentation and contour detection.
Saved processed frames to an output video.

### Challenges

Maintaining consistent detection across frames with varying lighting.
Optimized contour detection to reduce processing time.

### Performance

Consistent shape detection in the video.
Real-time processing achieved with efficient contour filtering.
